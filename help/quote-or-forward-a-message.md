# Quote or forward a message

[link-to-message]: /help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation

Conversations in Zulip are [organized by topic](/help/introduction-to-topics),
so it's generally clear what you're responding to when you send a message.
However, when responding to an older message, you may want to
[quote](#quote-a-message) all or part of it for reference.

You can also [forward](#forward-a-message) a message to another conversation.

The first line of a quoted or forwarded message contains a [permanent
link][link-to-message] to the original message. Zulip automatically turns
mentions in the quoted text into [silent
mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user) to avoid
unnecessarily mentioning someone twice.

!!! tip ""

    You can use [quote blocks](/help/format-a-quote)
    when quoting emails or other non-Zulip content.
