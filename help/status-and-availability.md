# Status and availability

Status and availability let everyone know roughly how quickly you'll be
responding to messages.

A **status** is a customizable emoji, along with a short message. A typical
status might be "üìÖ In a meeting" or "üè† Working remotely". To make it easy to
notice, the status emoji is shown next to your name in the sidebars, message
feed, and compose box.

Your **availability** is a colored dot (like <i class="user-circle user-circle-active zulip-icon zulip-icon-user-circle-active"></i>) that indicates if you're currently active on Zulip, idle,
or offline. You can also [go invisible](#invisible-mode) to appear offline
to other users.

    to always be shown in the right sidebar.

## Availability

There are three availability states:

* **Active** (<i class="user-circle user-circle-active zulip-icon
  zulip-icon-user-circle-active"></i>): Zulip is open and in focus on web,
  desktop or mobile, or was in the last 140 seconds.
* **Idle** (<i class="user-circle user-circle-idle zulip-icon
  zulip-icon-user-circle-idle"></i>): Zulip is open on your computer (either
  desktop or web), but you are not active.
* **Offline** (<i class="user-circle user-circle-offline zulip-icon
  zulip-icon-user-circle-offline"></i>): Zulip is not open on your computer,
  or you have turned on invisible mode.

### View availability

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

1. View a user's availability on the [user list](/help/user-list) in the right
   sidebar, the [direct messages](/help/direct-messages) list in the left
   sidebar, or their [user card](/help/user-cards). If there is no availability
   indicator, the user is offline.

!!! tip ""

    You can see when someone offline was last active by hovering over their
    name in the left or right sidebar.

{tab|mobile}

1. Tap on a user's profile picture or name. Their availability appears to the
   left of their name on their profile.

{end_tabs}

### Invisible mode

Zulip supports the privacy option of never updating the availability
information for your account. The result is that you will always
appear to other users as **Offline**, regardless of your activity in
Zulip.

With this setting, your "Last active" time displayed to other users in
the UI will be frozen as the approximate time you enabled this setting.
Your activity will still be included in your organization's [statistics](/help/analytics).

!!! tip ""

    Consider also [not
    allowing](/help/read-receipts#configure-whether-zulip-lets-others-see-when-youve-read-messages)
    other users to see when you have read messages.
