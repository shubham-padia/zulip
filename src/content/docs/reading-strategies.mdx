# Reading strategies

In Zulip, channels determine who gets a message. Topics tell you what
the message is about. If you are not yet familiar with Zulip's topics,
we recommend first reading about [channels](introduction-to-channels) and
[topics](/help/introduction-to-topics).

This article describes a few ways to efficiently read through messages
in Zulip.

## Conversation by conversation


In Zulip, a **conversation** is a [direct message](/help/direct-messages) thread
(one-on-one or with a group), or a [topic in a
channel](/help/introduction-to-topics).





It generally works best to read your messages organized by conversation.




### Finding a conversation to read

#### From the Inbox view


**Inbox** provides an overview of your conversations with unread messages.
Conversations are shown in the same order as in the left sidebar in the web app,
and you can collapse any channels you are not currently interested in.





<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-inbox"></i> **Inbox**
   (or <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-inbox"></i> if the **views**
   section is collapsed) in the left sidebar,
   or use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> keyboard shortcut.




1. Click on a conversation you're interested in to view it. You can return to
   **Inbox** when done to select the next conversation.

!!! tip ""

    You can collapse or expand the list of topics in a channel by clicking the
    **collapse**
    (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-arrow-down"></i>)
    or **expand**
    (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-arrow-down icon-collapsed-state"></i>)
    icon to the left of a channel name.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="mobile">

1. Tap the **Inbox**
   (<img src="/static/images/help/mobile-inbox-icon.svg" alt="inbox" class="help-center-icon"/>)
   tab in the bottom left corner of the app.

2. Tap on a conversation you're interested in to view it. You can return to
   **Inbox** when done to select the next conversation.

    **collapse**
    (<img src="/static/images/help/mobile-expand-less-icon.svg" alt="inbox" class="help-center-icon"/>)
    or **expand**
    (<img src="/static/images/help/mobile-expand-more-icon.svg" alt="inbox" class="help-center-icon"/>)
    icon to the left of a channel name.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>




#### From Recent conversations


Use the **Recent conversations** view to get
an overview of all the ongoing conversations. This view is particularly useful
for catching up on messages sent while you were away.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-recent"></i> **Recent conversations**
   (or <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-recent"></i> if the **views**
   section is collapsed) in the left sidebar,
   or use the <kbd>T</kbd> keyboard shortcut.




1. The filters at the top help you quickly find relevant conversations.
   For example, select **Participated** to filter to the conversations you
   have sent messages to.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

!!! tip ""

    The **Participants** column shows which users recently sent a message (newest on the left).




#### From the left sidebar


In the web app, the left sidebar provides quick access to your direct messages,
and the channels you are subscribed to.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on **DIRECT MESSAGES** or the name of a channel in the left sidebar. You
   will see a list of the most recent unread conversations that you have not [muted](/help/mute-a-topic).

1. Click on the conversation you are interested in.

!!! tip ""

    To see all conversations, click on **more conversations** (in direct messages) or **more topics**
    (in a channel).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>




### Reading conversations


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. [Find](/help/finding-a-conversation-to-read) a conversation to read.

1. Read the conversation, scrolling down with the mouse or by pressing
   <kbd>PgDn</kbd>.

1. If the conversation is not of interest, you can
   [mark all messages as read](/help/marking-messages-as-read) by
   jumping to the bottom with the **Scroll to bottom**
   (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) button or the <kbd>End</kbd> shortcut.

!!! keyboard_tip ""

    Use the <kbd>N</kbd> key to go to the next unread topic, or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>
    for the next unread [followed](/help/follow-a-topic) topic, or <kbd>P</kbd> for the next
    unread direct message conversation.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>




### Following, muting and unmuting conversations

You can improve your workflow for catching up on messages by taking advantage of
[following topics](/help/follow-a-topic), as well as muting and unmuting
[channels](/help/mute-a-channel) and [topics](/help/mute-a-topic). Some example
workflows:


- [Catch up](/help/follow-a-topic#catch-up-on-followed-topics) on
  followed topics at the start of the day, and whenever you want to
  spend a few minutes checking on on the conversations that need
  your attention.

- No more stressing about missing a reply to your message in channels
  you don't regularly read. You can [automatically
  follow](/help/follow-a-topic#automatically-follow-topics) topics you
  start or participate in.

- You can also [mute](/help/mute-a-channel) the channels you don't
  regularly read, and [automatically follow or
  unmute](/help/follow-a-topic#automatically-follow-topics) topics you
  start or participate in. In muted channels, topics you follow are
  automatically treated as [unmuted](/help/mute-a-topic), so it will
  be easy to see when someone responds to your message.

- If you like, follow just the topics where your prompt attention is
  needed, and [enable desktop and mobile
  notifications](/help/follow-a-topic#configure-notifications-for-followed-topics)
  for followed topics.




## Combined views

### Combined feed


The **Combined feed** view is a feed of all the unmuted messages you have
received, which combines channel messages and direct messages. It's a great way
to see new messages as they come in.

view](/help/configure-home-view#configure-home-view) for the Zulip web app.

   or use the <kbd>A</kbd> keyboard shortcut.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="mobile">
