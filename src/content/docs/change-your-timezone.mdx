# Change your time zone

Zulip always uses your computer's time zone for displaying dates and
timestamps (note that you need to reload Zulip after changing your
computer's time zone for changes to take effect).

By default, Zulip also indirectly displays your time zone to others, via the
**Local time** field of your [user profile](/help/view-someones-profile).
You can change the time zone Zulip displays to others.
