# Direct messages

**Direct messages (DMs)** are conversations with other users that happen outside
of a [channel](/help/introduction-to-channels). DMs work well for one-off messages,
usually with just one or two others.

If you find yourself frequently conversing with the same person or group, it
often works better to [create a private channel](/help/create-a-channel) for your
conversations. This lets you organize your discussion into topics, and add or
remove participants as needed.
