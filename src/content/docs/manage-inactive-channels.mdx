# Manage inactive channels

In normal Zulip usage, channels fall in and out of use. By default, Zulip
automatically moves channels that haven't been used in a while to the
**Inactive** section at the bottom of your channels list in the left sidebar.
This helps prevent low-traffic channels from cluttering the left sidebar.

You can configure Zulip to move (demote) inactive channels more or less
aggressively. This is an advanced setting; you can safely ignore it if this
is your first time using Zulip.

### Manage inactive channels

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. Click on the **gear** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-gear"></i>) icon in the upper
   right corner of the web or desktop app.

1. Select **Personal settings**.

1. On the left, click **Preferences**.



2. Under **Advanced**, configure **Demote inactive channels**.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The default is **Automatic**, which demotes inactive channels once you're
subscribed to a minimum total number of channels. **Always** and **Never**
either demote or don't demote inactive channels regardless of how many
channels you have.
