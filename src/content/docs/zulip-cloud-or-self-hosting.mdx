Zulip](https://zulip.com/self-hosting/) is the right choice for you depends on

([cloud][export-cloud], [self-hosted][export-self-hosted]) ensure you can always
move from our hosting to yours (and back). No matter which option you go with,
free or heavily discounted pricing is available for most non-business uses.
