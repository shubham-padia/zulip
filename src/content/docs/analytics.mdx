# Usage statistics

Zulip provides detailed analytics to help you see how you and your team are
using Zulip. The **Organization summary** section of the usage statistics page
includes your organization's overall usage information such as the total number
of users, guests, messages, and storage in use.

You will also find interactive graphs that provide a detailed breakdown of
your organization's number of active users, messages sent, messages received,
and how these statistics have changed over time.
