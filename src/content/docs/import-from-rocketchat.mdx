# Import from Rocket.Chat

You can import your current workspace into a Zulip organization. It's a great
way to preserve your workspace history when you migrate to Zulip, and to make
the transition easy for the members of your organization.

The import will include your organization's:

* **Name**
* **Message history**, including attachments and emoji reactions
* **Users**, including names, emails, roles, and teams
* **Channels**, including discussions and all user subscriptions
* **Custom emoji**

## Import process overview

To import your Rocket.Chat organization into Zulip, you will need to take the
following steps, which are described in more detail below:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. [Export your Rocket.Chat data](#export-your-rocketchat-data).

1. [Import your Rocket.Chat data into Zulip](#import-your-data-into-zulip).

1. [Get your organization started with Zulip](#get-your-organization-started-with-zulip)!

## Import your organization from Rocket.Chat into Zulip

### Export your Rocket.Chat data

Rocket.Chat does not provide an official data export feature, so the Zulip
import tool works by importing data from a Rocket.Chat database dump.

If you're self-hosting your Rocket.Chat instance, you can create a
database dump using the `mongodump` utility.

If your organization is hosted on Rocket.Chat Cloud or another hosting
provider that doesn't provide you with database access, you will need
to request a database dump by contacting their
[support](https://docs.rocket.chat/resources/frequently-asked-questions/cloud-faqs#data-export).

In either case, you should end up with a directory containing many
`.bson` files.

### Import your data into Zulip


To start using Zulip, you will need to choose between Zulip Cloud and
self-hosting Zulip. For a simple managed solution, with no setup or maintenance
overhead, you can [sign up](/new/) for Zulip Cloud with just a few clicks.
Alternatively, you can [self-host](/self-hosting/) your Zulip organization. See
[here](/help/zulip-cloud-or-self-hosting) to learn more.

!!! warn ""

    **You can only import a workspace as a new Zulip organization.** Your imported
    message history cannot be added into an existing Zulip organization.




At this point, you should go to the directory containing all the `.bson` files
from your database dump and rename it to `rocketchat_data`. This directory will
be your **exported data** file in the instructions below.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="zulip-cloud">

#### Import into a Zulip Cloud organization


If you are using Zulip Cloud, we'll take it from here! Please e-mail
[support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com) with the following information:




1. The subdomain you would like to use for your organization. Your Zulip chat will
   be hosted at `<subdomain>.zulipchat.com`.

1. The **exported data** file containing your workspace message history export.





!!! warn ""

    If the organization already exists, the import process will overwrite all
    data that's already there. If needed, we're happy to preserve your
    data by moving an organization you've already created to a new
    subdomain prior to running the import process.

<TabItem label="self-hosting">

#### Import into a self-hosted Zulip server

Zulip's import tools are robust, and have been used to import workspaces
with 10,000 members and millions of messages. If you're planning on doing
an import much larger than that, or run into performance issues when
importing, [contact us](/help/contact-support) for help.

1. Follow steps
   [1](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#step-1-download-the-latest-release)
   and
   [2](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#step-2-install-zulip)
   of the guide for [installing a new Zulip
   server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html).

1. Copy the **exported data** file containing your workspace message
   history export onto your Zulip server, and put it in `/tmp/`.

1. Log in to a shell on your Zulip server as the `zulip` user.




1. To import into an organization hosted on the root domain
   (`EXTERNAL_HOST`) of the Zulip installation, run the following
   commands.

    \{!import-self-hosted-server-tips.md!\}

    ```
    cd /home/zulip/deployments/current
    ./scripts/stop-server
    ./manage.py convert_rocketchat_data /tmp/rocketchat_data --output /tmp/converted_rocketchat_data
    ./manage.py import '' /tmp/converted_rocketchat_data
    ./scripts/start-server
    ```

    Alternatively, to import into a custom subdomain, run:

    ```
    cd /home/zulip/deployments/current
    ./scripts/stop-server
    ./manage.py convert_rocketchat_data /tmp/rocketchat_data --output /tmp/converted_rocketchat_data
    ./manage.py import <subdomain> /tmp/converted_rocketchat_data
    ./scripts/start-server
    ```

1. Follow [step 4](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#step-4-configure-and-use)
   of the guide for [installing a new Zulip
   server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Import details

Whether you are using Zulip Cloud or self-hosting Zulip, here are a few notes to
keep in mind about the import process:

- Rocket.Chat does not export workspace settings, so you will need to [configure
  the settings for your Zulip organization](/help/customize-organization-settings).
  This includes settings like [email
  visibility](/help/configure-email-visibility),
  [message editing permissions](/help/restrict-message-editing-and-deletion),
  and [how users can join your organization](/help/restrict-account-creation).

- Rocket.Chat does not export user settings, so users in your organization may
  want to [customize their account settings](/help/getting-started-with-zulip).

- Rocket.Chat user roles are mapped to Zulip's [user
  roles](/help/roles-and-permissions) in the following way:

| Rocket.Chat role | Zulip role |
|------------------|------------|
| Admin            | Owner      |
| User             | Member     |
| Guest            | Guest      |

- User avatars are not imported.

- Default channels for new users are not imported.

- Starred messages are not imported.

- Messages longer than Zulip's limit of 10,000 characters are not
  imported.

- Messages from Rocket.Chat Discussions are imported as topics
  inside the Zulip channel corresponding to the parent channel of the
  Rocket.Chat Discussion.

- Messages from Rocket.Chat Discussions having direct channels
  (i.e. direct messages) as their parent are imported as normal
  direct messages in Zulip.

- While Rocket.Chat Threads are in general imported as separate
  topics, Rocket.Chat Threads within Rocket.Chat Discussions are
  imported as normal messages within the topic containing that
  Discussion, and Threads in Direct Messages are imported as normal
  Zulip direct messages.

Additionally, because Rocket.Chat does not provide a documented or
stable data export API, the import tool may require small changes from
time to time to account for changes in the Rocket.Chat database
format.  Please [contact us](/help/contact-support) if you encounter
any problems using this tool.

## Get your organization started with Zulip


Once the import process is completed, you will need to:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. [Configure the settings for your organization](/help/customize-organization-settings),
    which are not exported. This includes settings like [email
    visibility](/help/configure-email-visibility), [message editing
    permissions](/help/restrict-message-editing-and-deletion),
    and [how users can join your organization](/help/restrict-account-creation).

2. All users from your previous workspace will have accounts in your new Zulip
   organization. However, you will need to let users know about their new
   accounts, and [decide how they will log
   in](/help/import-from-slack#decide-how-users-will-log-in) for the first time.

3. Share the URL for your new Zulip organization, and (recommended) the [Getting
   started with Zulip guide](/help/getting-started-with-zulip).

4. Migrate any [integrations](/integrations/).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>




## Decide how users will log in


When user accounts are imported, users initially do not have passwords
configured. There are a few options for how users can log in for the first time.

!!! tip ""

    For security reasons, passwords are never exported.

### Allow users to log in with non-password authentication

When you create your organization, users will immediately be able to log in with
[authentication methods](/help/configure-authentication-methods) that do not
require a password. Zulip offers a variety of authentication methods, including
Google, GitHub, GitLab, Apple, LDAP and [SAML](/help/saml-authentication).

### Send password reset emails to all users

You can send password reset emails to all users in your organization, which
will allow them to set an initial password.

If you imported your organization into Zulip Cloud, simply e-mail
[support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com) to request this.

!!! warn ""

    To avoid confusion, first make sure that the users in your
    organization are aware that their account has been moved to
    Zulip, and are expecting to receive a password reset email.

#### Send password reset emails (self-hosted organization)

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="default-subdomain">

1. To test the process, start by sending yourself a password reset email by
   using the following command:

     ```
     ./manage.py send_password_reset_email -u username@example.com
     ```

1. When ready, send password reset emails to all users by
   using the following command:

     ```
     ./manage.py send_password_reset_email -r '' --all-users
     ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="custom-subdomain">

1. To test the process, start by sending yourself a password reset email by
   using the following command:

     ```
     ./manage.py send_password_reset_email -u username@example.com
     ```

1. When ready, send password reset emails to all users by
   using the following command:

     ```
     ./manage.py send_password_reset_email -r <subdomain> --all-users
     ```

   If you would like to only send emails to users who have not logged in yet,
   you can use the following variant instead:

     ```
     ./manage.py send_password_reset_email -r <subdomain> --all-users --only-never-logged-in
     ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Manual password resets

Alternatively, users can reset their own passwords by following the instructions
on your Zulip organization's login page.
