# Create user groups


User groups allow you to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) multiple users
at once. When you mention a user group, everyone in the group is
[notified](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) as if they were personally
mentioned. For example, you may choose to create user groups for teams in your
organization.




## How to create a user group

## User group options

There are several parameters you can set while creating a user group, which can
all be changed later.

* **User group name**: The user group name can be in any language, and can
  include spaces and other punctuation.

* **User group description** (optional)

* **Who can mention this group?**: Configures who is allowed to
  [mention this group](/help/mention-a-user-or-group).

* **Choose members**: You can copy the membership from an existing channel or
  user group, add all users, or enter users one by one.
