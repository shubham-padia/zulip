# Delete a topic


!!! warn ""

    This feature is only available to organization owners and administrators.




We generally recommend against deleting topics, but there are a few
situations in which it can be useful:

* Clearing out test messages after setting up an organization.

* Clearing out messages from an overly enthusiastic bot.

* Managing abuse.

In most other cases, [renaming a topic](/help/rename-a-topic) is often a
better idea, or just leaving the topic as is. Deleting a topic can confuse
users who come to the topic later via an email notification.

Note that deleting a topic also deletes every message with that topic,
whereas [archiving a channel](/help/archive-a-channel) does not.

### Delete a topic

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Hover over a topic in the left sidebar.

1. Click on the **ellipsis** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-more-vertical"></i>).




1. Click **Delete topic**.

1. Approve by clicking **Confirm**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="mobile">

1. Press and hold a topic until the long-press menu appears.




1. Tap **Delete topic**.
1. Approve by tapping **DELETE TOPIC**.


!!! tip ""

    If you are viewing a single topic, you can access the long-press
    menu from the bar at the top of the app.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that deleting all of the individual messages within a particular
topic also deletes that topic. Structurally, topics are simply an
attribute of messages in Zulip.
