# Message formatting

Zulip uses Markdown to allow you to easily format your messages. Even if you've
never heard of Markdown, you are probably familiar with basic Markdown
formatting, such as using `*` at the start of a line in a bulleted list, or
around text to indicate emphasis.

Formatting buttons in the compose box make it easy to format your message. For
those who prefer to type the formatting they need, this page provides an
overview of all the formatting available in Zulip. There is a convenient
[message formatting reference](#message-formatting-reference) in the Zulip
app that you can use whenever you need a reminder of the formatting syntax
below.

There are several ways to use an emoji in your message:

- [Enter an emoji name](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#use-an-emoji-in-your-message)
  surrounded by `:`, with help from autocomplete suggestions.

- [Select an emoji from the emoji
  picker](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#use-an-emoji-in-your-message)

- [Use an emoticon](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#use-an-emoticon)

- [Paste an emoji](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#use-an-emoji-in-your-message)

default emoji, custom emoji can be entered into the compose box by name, or
selected from the emoji picker.

## Mention a user or group


You can mention a team member or [user group](/help/user-groups) to call their
attention to a message. Mentions follow the same [notification
settings](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) as direct messages and alert
words. A [silent mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user)
allows you to refer to a user without triggering a notification. A wildcard
mention allows you to
[mention everyone on a channel](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#mention-everyone-on-a-channel),
or [mention all topic participants](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#mention-all-topic-participants).





### What you type


wzxhzdk:9


!!! tip ""

    A `|` followed by a user ID is inserted automatically when you select a
    user from the typeahead suggestions, if there are two users with the same
    name in the organization.

## /me action messages


You can send messages that display your profile picture and name as the
beginning of the message content by beginning a message with `/me`. You can
use this feature in conversations when you want to describe actions you've
taken or things that are happening around you using a third-person voice.





For example, if you are **Ada Starr**:

### What it looks like

![Markdown status](/static/images/help/markdown-status.png)




## Global times


When collaborating with people in different time zones, you often need to
express a specific time clearly. In Zulip, rather than typing out your time
zone and having everyone translate the time in their heads, you can insert
a time, and it will be displayed to each user in their own time zone (just
like timestamps on Zulip messages).





### What you type

A date picker will appear once you type `<time`.


wzxhzdk:11


!!! tip ""

    You can also use other formats such as UNIX timestamps or human readable
    dates, for example, `<time:May 28 2020, 1:30 PM IST>`.

### What it looks like

A person in San Francisco will see:

> Our next meeting is scheduled for *Thu, May 28 2020, 1:00 AM*.

While someone in India will see:

> Our next meeting is scheduled for *Thu, May 28 2020, 1:30 PM*.




!!! tip ""

    You can also use the **Add global time**
    (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-time"></i>) button in the compose
    box to select a time from the date picker. [Learn more](/help/global-times).

## Tables


Zulip supports Markdown formatting for tables.





### What you type


wzxhzdk:12


!!! tip ""

    The initial pipes (`|`) are optional if every entry in the first column is
    non-empty.
    The header separators (`---`) must be at least three dashes long.

### What it looks like

![Markdown table](/static/images/help/markdown-table.png)




## Collaborative to-do lists


Zulip supports creating shared to-do lists where any user who can access the
message can add tasks by entering the task's title and description, and clicking
**Add task**. Once created, task titles and descriptions cannot be edited. The task
list title can be edited any time by the to-do list's creator.

!!! tip ""

    Tasks can be marked (and unmarked) as completed by clicking the
    checkboxes on the left.

different sections of content.
