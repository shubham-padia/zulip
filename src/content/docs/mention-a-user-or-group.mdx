# Mention a user or group


You can mention a team member or [user group](/help/user-groups) to call their
attention to a message. Mentions follow the same [notification
settings](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) as direct messages and alert
words. A [silent mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user)
allows you to refer to a user without triggering a notification. A wildcard
mention allows you to
[mention everyone on a channel](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#mention-everyone-on-a-channel),
or [mention all topic participants](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#mention-all-topic-participants).




## Mention a user or group

### From the compose box

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. [Open the compose box](/help/open-the-compose-box).




2. Type `@` followed by a few letters from a name or email address.

3. Pick the appropriate user or user group from the autocomplete.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### From the user list

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. Hover over a user's name in the right sidebar.

1. Click on the **ellipsis** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-more-vertical"></i>)
   to the right of their name to open their **user card**.




1. Select **Copy mention syntax** to add it to your clipboard.

1. Paste the user's mention syntax in the compose box.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Via a message

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. Click on a user's profile picture or name on a message they sent
   to open their **user card**.

1. Select **Reply mentioning user** to start a reply to the conversation
   with a mention inserted into the compose box.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Silently mention a user

A silent mention allows you to refer to a user without triggering a
notification. Silent mentions start with `@_` instead of `@`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. [Open the compose box](/help/open-the-compose-box).




2. Type `@_` followed by a few letters from a name or email address.

3. Pick the appropriate user or user group from the autocomplete.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Mention all topic participants

Using the `@**topic**` mention, you can mention everyone who has previously
participated in the topic by sending a message or
[reacting](/help/emoji-reactions) with an emoji. This lets you notify just those
who have already engaged in the conversation.

Users can disable notifications for `@**topic**` mentions by:

- Disabling notifications for wildcard mentions
[globally](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) or for [individual
channels](/help/channel-notifications).

- Muting the [topic](/help/mute-a-topic) or [channel](/help/mute-a-channel).

## Mention everyone on a channel

You can mention everyone on a channel with the `@**all**` mention (or,
equivalently, `@**everyone**` or `@**channel**`). It's best to use these mentions
only when your message requires timely attention from many channel subscribers.
An organization can be configured to
[restrict](/help/restrict-wildcard-mentions) wildcard mentions in large channels.

Users can disable notifications for `@**all**`, `@**everyone**`, and
`@**channel**` mentions by:

- Disabling notifications for wildcard mentions
[globally](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) or for [individual
channels](/help/channel-notifications).

- Muting the [topic](/help/mute-a-topic) or [channel](/help/mute-a-channel).
