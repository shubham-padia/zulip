# Mute or unmute a channel


Zulip lets you mute topics and channels to avoid receiving notifications for messages
you are not interested in. Muting a channel effectively mutes all topics in
that channel. You can also manually **mute** a topic in an unmuted channel, or
**unmute** a topic in a muted channel.

Muting has the following effects:

- Messages in muted topics do not generate notifications (including [alert
  word](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications#alert-words) notifications), unless
  you are [mentioned](/help/mention-a-user-or-group).
- Messages in muted topics do not appear in the [**Combined feed**
  view](/help/combined-feed) or the mobile **Inbox** view.
- Muted topics appear in the [**Recent conversations**
  view](/help/recent-conversations) only if the **Include muted** filter is
  enabled.
- Unread messages in muted topics do not contribute to channel unread counts.
- Muted topics and channels are grayed out in the left sidebar of the desktop/web
  app, and in the mobile app.
- In the desktop/web app, muted topics are sorted to the bottom of their channel,
  and muted channels are sorted to the bottom of their channel section.

    **Note**: Some parts of the Zulip experience may start to degrade
    if you receive more than a few hundred muted messages a day.
