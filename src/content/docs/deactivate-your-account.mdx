# Deactivate your account

In Zulip, you have a dedicated account for each organization you belong to.
Deactivating your Zulip account in one organization will have no effect on any
other Zulip accounts you may have.

Once you deactivate your account, you cannot register in the same organization
with the email address you used before. If you are re-joining an organization,
ask an organization administrator to
[reactivate](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user#reactivate-a-user) your
account.

!!! tip ""

    You can find all the Zulip Cloud accounts associated with your email address
    with the [**Find your accounts**](https://zulip.com/accounts/find/) tool.
    If you have forgotten your account password, you can
    [reset it](/help/change-your-password).


## Deactivate your account

!!! warn ""

    If you are the only owner in the organization, you cannot
    deactivate your account. You will need to
    [add another owner](/help/change-a-users-role) first.

* Your [user card](/help/user-cards) will have a notice indicating that your
  account has been deactivated.

* Deactivating your account won't delete messages you've sent or files
  you've shared. If permitted in your organization, delete content you'd
  like to remove before deactivating your account.

* Any bots that you maintain will be disabled.
