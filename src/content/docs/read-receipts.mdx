# Read receipts

Read receipts let you check who has read a message. You can see read receipts
for any message, including both [channel messages](/help/introduction-to-channels)
and [direct messages](/help/direct-messages).

With privacy in mind, Zulip lets you [control][configure-personal-read-receipts]
whether your read receipts are shared, and administrators can
[choose][configure-organization-read-receipts] whether to enable read receipts in
their organization.

!!! tip ""
    Read receipts reflect whether or not someone has marked a message as read,
    whether by viewing it, or [by marking messages as read in
    bulk](/help/marking-messages-as-read).

## View who has read a message

a message. If this setting is turned off, your name will never appear in the
list of read receipts.
