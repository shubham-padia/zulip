# Create a channel

By default, all users other than guests can create channels. Administrators can
[restrict the ability to create a channel](/help/configure-who-can-create-channels) to specific
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions).

If you are an administrator setting up channels for the first time, check out our
[guide to setting up channels for a new organization](/help/create-channels).
