# Introduction to topics


Zulip is designed around conversations that are labeled with **topics**, to make
communication organized and efficient. It’s easy to get an overview of what
conversations are happening, and to read one conversation at a time.

Here is what topics look like in Zulip.

Topics are one of the most wonderful aspects of using Zulip:

* Lots of conversations can happen in the same channel at the same time, each in
  its own topic. You never have to worry about interrupting — each conversation
  has its own space.
* Conversations can last many hours or days, letting everyone respond in their
  own time. Don't worry about replying long after a message is sent —
  everyone will see your reply in context.

helps transform how your organization communicates.




## When to start a new topic


To get the full benefits of Zulip's topic model, when starting a new
conversation, you should start a new topic!

Starting a topic is like a lighter weight version of giving your email a subject.
Topic names should be brief but specific, e.g.:

* **Good topic names:** "question about topics", "welcome Anna Smith!", "issue #1234"
* **Not so good topic names:** "question", "hi", "help", "this topic is about
a question I have about topics"

!!! tip ""
    Don't overthink naming your topic. The first 2-3 words that come to mind
    are probably fine!
