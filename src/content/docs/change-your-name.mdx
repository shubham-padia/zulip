# Change your name

By default, everyone can change their name in Zulip. You can write your name
in any language you'd like.

Organization administrators can [change anyone's name](/help/change-a-users-name), and
[prevent users from changing their names](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes). This
is useful when users' names are managed via LDAP or another data source.

    **Note:** If you are unable to edit the name field, check
    that your organization allows name changes. Follow the steps at
    [prevent users from changing their names](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes)
    to view your organization's settings.
