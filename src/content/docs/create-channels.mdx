# Create channels



Channels organize conversations based on who needs to see them. For example, it
is common to have a channel for each team in an organization. Because Zulip
further organizes messages into conversations labeled with
[topics](/help/introduction-to-topics), there is generally no need to create
dedicated channels for specific projects.




We recommend setting up some channels before inviting other users to
join Zulip, so that you can [automatically subscribe
everyone](/help/set-default-channels-for-new-users) to the right set of
channels.

If you later create additional channels, no worries! You can always add
a group of users or all the members of another channel to a new channel.

    Add clear descriptions to your channels, especially public channels.

## Tips for creating channels


* It's often best to start with just a few channels, and add more as
  needed. For small teams, you can start with the default channels
  and go from there.

* For large organizations, we recommend using a consistent naming
  scheme, like `#marketing/<name>` or `#mk/<name>` for all channels
  pertaining to the marketing team, `#help/<team name>` for
  `<team name>`'s internal support channel, etc.

* For open source projects or other volunteer organizations, consider
  adding default channels like `#announce` for announcements, `#new
  members` for new members to introduce themselves and be welcomed,
  and `#help` so that there's a clear place users stopping by with
  just a single question can post.
