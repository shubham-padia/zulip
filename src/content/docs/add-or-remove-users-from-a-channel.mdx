# Add or remove users from a channel

By default, anyone (other than guests) subscribed to a channel can add
users to that channel. Additionally, anyone (other than guests) can add
users to a public channel, whether or not they are subscribed to the
channel. Anyone can always [unsubscribe themselves from a channel][unsubscribe].

Organization administrators can also unsubscribe *other* users from any channel,
including channels the admin is not subscribed to. They can also configure which
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions) have access to [add other users to a
channel][add-users] or [remove other users from a channel][remove-users].
