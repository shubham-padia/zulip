# Setting up your organization

Welcome to Zulip! This page will guide you through trying out Zulip,
migrating your organization from other team chat tools (if needed),
getting everything set up, and inviting others to join.

If you are joining an existing organization, we recommend checking out
our guide to [Getting started with Zulip][getting-started].

[getting-started]: /help/getting-started-with-zulip

If you encounter any problems as you're getting started, please drop
by our [friendly development community](/development-community/) and let
us know!

## Trying out Zulip


You can start by reading about how [Zulip’s](/hello/) unique
topic-based threading [combines the best of email and
chat](/why-zulip/) to make [remote work](https://zulip.com/for/business/) productive
and delightful.

It's also easy to try out Zulip for yourself.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. **Check out the Zulip app**. You can:

    - [View the Zulip development community](https://zulip.com/try-zulip/),
      where hundreds of participants collaborate to improve Zulip. Many parts of
      the community are open for [public access](/help/public-access-option), so
      you can start exploring without creating an account.

    - [See how Zulip is being used](https://zulip.com/communities/) in open
      organizations that have opted in to be listed in the [Zulip communities
      directory](/help/communities-directory).

1. [Create a Zulip Cloud organization](https://zulip.com/new/) for free in just
   a few minutes. This is a great way to explore Zulip even if you plan to
   [self-host](https://zulip.com/self-hosting/).

1. [Invite your teammates](/help/invite-users-to-join) to explore Zulip with you.
   They will have a variety of perspectives on what's important in a chat app.

1. **Run a week-long Zulip trial** with your team, without using any other chat tools. This
   is the only way to truly experience how a new chat app will help your team
   communicate. You can:

    - Customize [organization settings](/help/customize-organization-settings)
      and [settings for new users](/help/customize-settings-for-new-users), but
      plan to adjust the details as you go.

    - [Create](/help/create-channels) your initial
      [channels](/help/introduction-to-channels), including a dedicated channel for
      questions and feedback about using Zulip.

    - Educate others about how to use Zulip's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics),
      and how to [move](/help/move-content-to-another-topic) any messages that
      belong elsewhere.

    - [Set up integrations](/help/set-up-integrations) so that your team can
      experience all their regular workflows inside the Zulip app.

## Choosing between Zulip Cloud and self-hosting


Whether [signing up for Zulip Cloud](https://zulip.com/new/) or [self-hosting
Zulip](https://zulip.com/self-hosting/) is the right choice for you depends on
the needs of your organization.

If you aren’t sure what you need, our high quality export and import tools
([cloud][export-cloud], [self-hosted][export-self-hosted]) ensure you can always
move from our hosting to yours (and back). No matter which option you go with,
free or heavily discounted pricing is available for most non-business uses.

[export-cloud]: /help/export-your-organization
[export-self-hosted]: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/export-and-import.html




### Advantages of Zulip Cloud


* Simple managed solution, with no setup or maintenance
  overhead. [Sign up](https://zulip.com/new/) with just a few clicks.
* Always updated to the latest version of Zulip.
* Anyone can [start with Zulip Cloud Free](https://zulip.com/new/).




### Advantages of self-hosting Zulip


* All [self-hosted plans](https://zulip.com/plans/#self-hosted) offer the same
  [100% open-source software] [zulip-github]. Organizations that do not require
  support with their installation can always use Zulip for free with no
  limitations.

* Retain full control over your data and simplify compliance by self-hosting
  Zulip behind your firewall.

* We work hard to make it easy to [install][install-zulip], [back
  up][back-up-zulip], and [maintain][maintain-zulip] a self-hosted
  Zulip server. Self-host Zulip directly on Ubuntu or Debian Linux, in
  <a href="https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip">Docker</a>, or with
  prebuilt images for <a
  href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/zulip">Digital
  Ocean</a> and <a
  href="https://render.com/docs/deploy-zulip">Render</a>.

* Customize Zulip for all your needs. It's easy to develop and maintain [custom
  integrations](/api/incoming-webhooks-overview) and [features][modify-zulip].

## Migrating from other chat tools


If your organization is moving to Zulip from another chat tool, you can use
Zulip's tools to import your data, including users, channels, messages, and
more. Follow the detailed import guides:

* [Import from Slack](/help/import-from-slack). Zulip's [Slack-compatible
  incoming webhook](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming) also
  makes it easy to migrate any integrations.
* [Import from Mattermost](/help/import-from-mattermost)
* [Import from Rocket.Chat](/help/import-from-rocketchat)

!!! warn ""

    **You can only import a workspace as a new Zulip organization.** Your imported
    message history cannot be added into an existing Zulip organization.




## Create your organization profile


The information in your organization profile is displayed on your organization's
registration and login pages, and (optionally) in the [communities
directory](/help/communities-directory). Your **organization profile picture**
is also used for [switching between
organizations](/help/switching-between-organizations) in the Desktop app.

    including **bold**/*italic*, links, lists, and more.

### Add a wide logo



!!! warn ""

    Zulip Cloud customers who wish to use this feature must upgrade to
    [Zulip Cloud Standard](https://zulip.com/plans/) or [Zulip Cloud
    Plus](https://zulip.com/plans/).




You can customize the logo users see in the top left corner
of the Zulip app. For best results:

- The logo should be a wide rectangle image with an 8:1 width to height ratio.
  It will be displayed at 200×25 pixels, or more on high-resolution displays.

- Make sure your logo has a transparent background, and trim any bordering
  whitespace.

To upload a logo:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. Click on the **gear** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-gear"></i>) icon in the upper
   right corner of the web or desktop app.

1. Select **Organization settings**.

1. On the left, click **Organization profile**.



1. Under **Organization logo**, upload a new logo.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Make sure to test the logo in both light theme and [dark theme](/help/dark-theme).




## Customize organization settings



Review the settings for your organization to set everything up how you
want it to be.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. Click on the **gear** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-gear"></i>) icon in
   the upper right corner of the web or desktop app.

1. Select **<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-building"></i> Organization settings**.



1. Click on the **Organization settings** and **Organization
   permissions** tabs, as well as any others that are of interest.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>




A few settings to highlight:

* Decide [who can invite new users][who-can-invite], or whether
  [anyone can join without an invitation][who-can-join].

* [Set visibility for users' email addresses][email-address-visibility].

* If your organization uses a programming language, set the [default
  language for code blocks][default-code-block-language]. Also
  consider setting up [code playgrounds][code-playgrounds].

* If your organization uses code repositories, [set up
  linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) to make it easy to link to
  issues (e.g. just by typing #1234 for issue 1234).

* [Add custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji), including your organization's logo.

For many other settings, e.g., [message][message-editing-permissions] and
[topic][topic-editing-permissions] editing permissions, you can experience how
Zulip works for your organization before deciding what settings are best for
you.

[message-editing-permissions]: /help/restrict-message-editing-and-deletion
[topic-editing-permissions]: /help/restrict-moving-messages
[default-code-block-language]: /help/code-blocks#default-code-block-language
[code-playgrounds]: /help/code-blocks#code-playgrounds
[email-address-visibility]: /help/configure-email-visibility
[who-can-invite]: /help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations
[who-can-join]: /help/restrict-account-creation#set-whether-invitations-are-required-to-join




## Create channels



Channels organize conversations based on who needs to see them. For example, it
is common to have a channel for each team in an organization. Because Zulip
further organizes messages into conversations labeled with
[topics](/help/introduction-to-topics), there is generally no need to create
dedicated channels for specific projects.




We recommend setting up some channels before inviting other users to
join Zulip, so that you can [automatically subscribe
everyone](/help/set-default-channels-for-new-users) to the right set of
channels.

If you later create additional channels, no worries! You can always add
a group of users or all the members of another channel to a new channel.

!!! tip ""
    Add clear descriptions to your channels, especially public channels.




### How to create a channel

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. Click on the **gear** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-gear"></i>) icon in
   the upper right corner of the web or desktop app.

1. Select <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-hash"></i> **Channel settings**.

1. Click **All channels** in the upper left.



1. Click **Create channel** on the right.

1. Fill out the requested info, and click **Create**.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For more details about channel settings, see [Create a
channel](/help/create-a-channel#channel-options).

### Tips for creating channels


* It's often best to start with just a few channels, and add more as
  needed. For small teams, you can start with the default channels
  and go from there.

* For large organizations, we recommend using a consistent naming
  scheme, like `#marketing/<name>` or `#mk/<name>` for all channels
  pertaining to the marketing team, `#help/<team name>` for
  `<team name>`'s internal support channel, etc.

* For open source projects or other volunteer organizations, consider
  adding default channels like `#announce` for announcements, `#new
  members` for new members to introduce themselves and be welcomed,
  and `#help` so that there's a clear place users stopping by with
  just a single question can post.




## Customize settings for new users


Customize settings for new users to get them off to a great start.

* [Add custom profile fields](/help/custom-profile-fields#add-a-custom-profile-field), such as pronouns
  or job title.
* [Configure default new user settings][default-user-settings].
* [Set default channels for new users](/help/set-default-channels-for-new-users).
* [Set organization language for automated messages and invitation emails][org-lang],
  if it should be something other than American English.

[org-lang]: /help/configure-organization-language
[default-user-settings]: /help/configure-default-new-user-settings




## Invite users to join

!!! tip ""
     Before inviting users, you may want to [delete any test messages][delete-message]
     or [topics](/help/delete-a-topic).

[delete-message]: /help/delete-a-message#delete-a-message-completely

### How to invite users to join


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="require-invitations">

   methods](/help/configure-authentication-methods). By default, Zulip allows

   allowed authentication method][logging-in], regardless of how they signed up.

## Create user groups

User groups allow you to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) multiple
users at once, [notifying](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) them about a message. For example, you may choose to create user groups for teams in your organization.
