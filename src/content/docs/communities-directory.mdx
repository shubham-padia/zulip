# Zulip communities directory


The [Zulip communities directory](https://zulip.com/communities/) offers
publicly accessible [Zulip Cloud][zulip-cloud] organizations an opportunity to
be listed on the [Zulip website](https://zulip.com). It's a way for [open-source
projects](https://zulip.com/for/open-source/), [research
communities](https://zulip.com/for/research/), and
[others](https://zulip.com/for/communities/) to advertise their Zulip community
and support the Zulip project.

The directory will display your community's name, logo, and a link to you Zulip
chat. Other information from your [organization
profile](/help/create-your-organization-profile) and the size of your
organization may be included as well.

## Eligibility

In order to be eligible for listing in the communities directory, an
organization must be open to the public. Your organization is eligible
if users are allowed to [join without an invitation][join-without-invite]
and/or the [public access option](/help/public-access-option) is enabled.

The directory will be organized by [organization type](/help/organization-type),
so it is highly recommended that you make sure the appropriate category
is selected.

To prevent spam, Zulip reserves the right to use editorial discretion.
Giving Zulip permission to promote your organization in the communities
directory does not guarantee that it will be listed.

### Self-hosted Zulip communities

Zulip plans to develop support for self-hosted Zulip communities that
have registered their servers with the [Zulip mobile push
notification service][push-notifications] to sign-up for the Zulip
communities directory.

Until that feature is developed, if you administer a self-hosted Zulip
community and would like to be listed in the directory, please contact
[Zulip support](mailto:support@zulip.com). Changing the setting in your
Zulip organization will not send any information to the Zulip project
at this time, even if you use the Zulip mobile push notifications
service.
