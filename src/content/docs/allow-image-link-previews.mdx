# Block image and website previews


!!! warn ""

    This feature is only available to organization owners and administrators.




By default, when a user links to an image or a website, a preview of the
image or website content is shown. You can choose to disable previews of
images and/or website links.

Zulip proxies all external images in messages through the server, to
prevent images from being used to track Zulip users.
