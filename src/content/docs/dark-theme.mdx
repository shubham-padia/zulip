# Dark theme

Zulip provides both a light theme and a dark theme, which is great
for working in a dark space.

## Manage color theme

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on your **profile picture** in the upper right
   corner of the web or desktop app.




1. Select the desired theme using the row of icons in the middle of the menu.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="mobile">

1. Tap your **profile picture** in the bottom right corner of the app.




1. Tap **Settings**.

1. Toggle **Night mode**.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The default is **Automatic (follows system settings)**, which detects which
theme to use based on the color scheme used by your operating system.

You can also specify **Light** or **Dark** if you'd like Zulip to use the same
color scheme regardless of your operating system configuration.
