# Status and availability

Status and availability let everyone know roughly how quickly you'll be
responding to messages.

A **status** is a customizable emoji, along with a short message. A typical
status might be "üìÖ In a meeting" or "üè† Working remotely". To make it easy to
notice, the status emoji is shown next to your name in the sidebars, message
feed, and compose box.

Your **availability** is a colored dot (like <span class="indicator green
solid"></span>) that indicates if you're currently active on Zulip, idle,
or offline. You can also [go invisible](#invisible-mode) to appear offline
to other users.

    button in the top right corner of the app to open their profile.

</Tabs>

## Availability

There are three availability states:

* **Active** (<span class="indicator green solid"></span>): Zulip is
  open and in focus on web, desktop or mobile, or was in the last 140
  seconds.

* **Idle** (<span class="indicator orange"></span>): Zulip is open on
  your computer (either desktop or web), but you are not active.

* **Offline** (<span class="indicator grey"></span>): Zulip is not open
  on your computer, or you have turned on invisible mode.

You can see when someone offline was last active by hovering over their
name in the left or right sidebar.

### Invisible mode

Zulip supports the privacy option of never updating the availability
information for your account. The result is that you will always
appear to other users as **Offline**, regardless of your activity in
Zulip.

With this setting, your "Last active" time displayed to other users in
the UI will be frozen as the approximate time you enabled this setting.

### Toggle invisible mode

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Hover over your name in the right sidebar.

1. Click on the **ellipsis** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-more-vertical"></i>)
   to open your **user card**.




1. To enable, you'll select **Go invisible**.

1. To disable, you'll select **Turn off invisible mode**.

    You can also toggle this setting in the **Account & privacy**
    tab of your **Personal settings** menu.
