# Follow a topic

Zulip lets you follow topics you are interested in. You can follow or unfollow
any topic. You can also configure Zulip to automatically follow topics you start
or participate in. Participating in a topic means sending a message,
[reacting](/help/emoji-reactions) with an emoji, or participating in a
[poll](/help/create-a-poll). You can also automatically follow topics where you
are [mentioned](/help/mention-a-user-or-group).

It's easy to prioritize catching up on followed topics. You can:

- [Configure](/help/follow-a-topic#configure-notifications-for-followed-topics)
  how you get notified about new messages for topics you follow.

- Use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> [keyboard
  shortcut](/help/keyboard-shortcuts) to go to the next unread followed topic.

- Filter the [**inbox**](/help/inbox) and [**recent
  conversations**](/help/recent-conversations) views to only show followed
  topics.

- See which topics you are following in the **left sidebar**.

You can use followed topics for a variety of workflows:


- [Catch up](/help/follow-a-topic#catch-up-on-followed-topics) on
  followed topics at the start of the day, and whenever you want to
  spend a few minutes checking on on the conversations that need
  your attention.

- No more stressing about missing a reply to your message in channels
  you don't regularly read. You can [automatically
  follow](/help/follow-a-topic#automatically-follow-topics) topics you
  start or participate in.

- You can also [mute](/help/mute-a-channel) the channels you don't
  regularly read, and [automatically follow or
  unmute](/help/follow-a-topic#automatically-follow-topics) topics you
  start or participate in. In muted channels, topics you follow are
  automatically treated as [unmuted](/help/mute-a-topic), so it will
  be easy to see when someone responds to your message.

- If you like, follow just the topics where your prompt attention is
  needed, and [enable desktop and mobile
  notifications](/help/follow-a-topic#configure-notifications-for-followed-topics)
  for followed topics.
