# Getting started with Zulip

Welcome to Zulip! This page guides you through getting started using
Zulip. If you are setting up a new organization, you may also want to
check out our [guide for setting up a new Zulip
organization](/help/getting-your-organization-started-with-zulip).

Mastering Zulip can take a bit of time, but once you get the hang of
it, you'll never want to use a different team chat app!

## Set up your account


!!! tip ""

    If this is your first time using Zulip, we recommend starting with the web
    or desktop experience to set up your account and get oriented.

- Get the [mobile and desktop apps](/apps/). Zulip also works great in a
  [browser](/help/supported-browsers).

- [Add a profile picture](/help/change-your-profile-picture) and
  [edit your profile information](/help/edit-your-profile) to tell others
  about yourself.

- [Review your Preferences](/help/review-your-settings#review-your-preferences).
  You can [switch between light and dark theme](/help/dark-theme),
  [pick your favorite emoji theme](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#change-your-emoji-set),
  [change your language](/help/change-your-language), and make other tweaks to your Zulip experience.

- [Browse and subscribe to channels](/help/introduction-to-channels#browse-and-subscribe-to-channels).

- Decide whether you want <kbd>Enter</kbd> [to send your message
  or add a new line](/help/mastering-the-compose-box#toggle-between-ctrl-enter-and-enter-to-send-a-message).

- [Configure your notifications](/#settings/notifications) to work the way
  you do. If you're joining a low traffic organization and aren't using the
  desktop app, consider sending all messages to email.




## Learn about Zulip topics


Zulip is designed around conversations that are labeled with **topics**, to make
communication organized and efficient. It’s easy to get an overview of what
conversations are happening, and to read one conversation at a time.

Here is what topics look like in Zulip.

![Channels and topics](/static/images/help/channels-and-topics.png)

Topics are one of the most wonderful aspects of using Zulip:

* Lots of conversations can happen in the same channel at the same time, each in
  its own topic. You never have to worry about interrupting — each conversation
  has its own space.
* Conversations can last many hours or days, letting everyone respond in their
  own time. Don't worry about replying long after a message is sent —
  everyone will see your reply in context.

Check out [Why Zulip](/why-zulip/) to learn more about how Zulip's topic model
helps transform how your organization communicates.




## Reading your messages


In Zulip, a **conversation** is a [direct message](/help/direct-messages) thread
(one-on-one or with a group), or a [topic in a
channel](/help/introduction-to-topics).





It generally works best to read your messages organized by conversation.




### Finding a conversation to read

#### From the Inbox view


**Inbox** provides an overview of your conversations with unread messages.
Conversations are shown in the same order as in the left sidebar in the web app,
and you can collapse any channels you are not currently interested in.

   section is collapsed) in the left sidebar,
   or use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> keyboard shortcut.

   **Inbox** when done to select the next conversation.

    icon to the left of a channel name.

an overview of all the ongoing conversations. This view is particularly useful
for catching up on messages sent while you were away.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-recent"></i> **Recent conversations**
   (or <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-recent"></i> if the **views**
   section is collapsed) in the left sidebar,
   or use the <kbd>T</kbd> keyboard shortcut.




1. The filters at the top help you quickly find relevant conversations.
   For example, select **Participated** to filter to the conversations you
   have sent messages to.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

!!! tip ""

    The **Participants** column shows which users recently sent a message (newest on the left).




#### From the left sidebar


In the web app, the left sidebar provides quick access to your direct messages,
and the channels you are subscribed to.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on **DIRECT MESSAGES** or the name of a channel in the left sidebar. You
   will see a list of the most recent unread conversations that you have not [muted](/help/mute-a-topic).

1. Click on the conversation you are interested in.

!!! tip ""

    To see all conversations, click on **more conversations** (in direct messages) or **more topics**

   [mark all messages as read](/help/marking-messages-as-read) by
   jumping to the bottom with the **Scroll to bottom**
   (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) button or the <kbd>End</kbd> shortcut.

!!! keyboard_tip ""

    Use the <kbd>N</kbd> key to go to the next unread topic, or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>
    for the next unread [followed](/help/follow-a-topic) topic, or <kbd>P</kbd> for the next
    unread direct message conversation.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>




## Sending messages

### When to start a new topic


To get the full benefits of Zulip's topic model, when starting a new
conversation, you should start a new topic!

Starting a topic is like a lighter weight version of giving your email a subject.
Topic names should be brief but specific, e.g.:

* **Good topic names:** "question about topics", "welcome Anna Smith!", "issue #1234"
* **Not so good topic names:** "question", "hi", "help", "this topic is about
a question I have about topics"

!!! tip ""
    Don't overthink naming your topic. The first 2-3 words that come to mind
    are probably fine!




### How to start a new topic
