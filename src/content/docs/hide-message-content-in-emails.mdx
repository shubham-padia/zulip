# Hide message content in emails


!!! warn ""

    This feature is only available to organization owners and administrators.




For security or compliance reasons, you may want to prevent Zulip message
content from being sent through your email system. The only place Zulip
currently sends message content is in message notification emails.

This setting also blocks message topics, channel names, and user names from
being sent through the email system.
