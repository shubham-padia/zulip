types of organizations are generally eligible for a free Zulip Cloud Standard plan.

- Research in an academic setting, such as research groups, cross-institutional
  collaborations, etc.
- Academic conferences and other non-profit events.

The following types of organizations are generally eligible for significant
discounts on Zulip Cloud Standard.

  pricing](https://zulip.com/for/education/#feature-pricing).

- Discounts are available for organizations based in the **developing world**.

- Non-profits and other organizations where many users are **not paid staff**
  are generally eligible for a discount.

If there are any circumstances that make regular pricing unaffordable for your
organization, contact [sales@zulip.com](mailto:sales@zulip.com) to discuss your
situation.

### Education pricing

Educators using Zulip with students are eligible for discounted [education
pricing](https://zulip.com/for/education/#feature-pricing). Other educational
uses (e.g., by teaching staff or university IT) may qualify for a non-profit
discount instead.

!!! tip ""
    Organizations operated by individual educators (for example, a professor
    teaching one or more classes) usually find that the [Zulip Cloud Free
    plan](https://zulip.com/plans/#cloud) suits their needs.


Non-profit educational pricing applies to online purchases with no additional
legal agreements, for use at registered non-profit institutions (e.g. colleges
and universities).

To arrange discounted pricing for your organization, please [apply for
sponosorship](#apply-for-sponsorship). Contact
[sales@zulip.com](mailto:sales@zulip.com) with any questions.

## Differences between Zulip Cloud plans

### How does having 10,000 messages of search history on Zulip Cloud Free work?

Only the most recent 10,000 messages can be viewed and searched on the Zulip
Cloud Free plan. Older messages are still stored and will become available
again if the organization is upgraded to Zulip Cloud Standard.

### Will you switch to limiting Zulip Cloud Free history to messages sent in the last 90 days (like Slack has)?

**No.** As discussed in [this blog
post](https://blog.zulip.com/2022/08/26/why-slacks-free-plan-change-is-causing-an-exodus/),
a time-based limit to message history is simply a bad model for a collaboration
tool.

## Payment methods

### Can I pay by credit card and/or invoice?

You can always use a credit card to pay. If you would like to pay by invoice,
you will need to sign up for an annual plan.

### How does automatic billing work?


!!! tip ""

    Automatic billing is recommended unless you have a specific reason to
    choose manual billing.

With automatic billing, you automatically purchase a Zulip license for each user
in your organization at the start of each billing period (month or year), and
whenever you need additional licenses.

- [Deactivating a user](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user) frees up their
  license for reuse. No refunds are given for unused licenses you have
  purchased. For example, if you start a billing period with 10 users,
  deactivate 5 users, and then add 2 new users, you will be billed for 10
  licenses for the entire billing period.

- If you have no free licenses when you **add a user**, you will be automatically
  billed for an additional license. You will be charged only for the remaining
  part of the billing period. For example, if you are on a $8/user/month monthly
  plan, you will be billed $4 for a user added half way through the month. Each
  month, you will see a single charge for all licenses added that month.




### How does manual billing work?


With manual billing, you choose and pay for a preset user limit. If
the limit is reached, no more users can join until licenses are manually
added.




#### Manually manage licenses

If your organization is on a manual billing plan, you can manage the number of
licenses on your organization's billing page.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on the **gear** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-gear"></i>) icon in
   the upper right corner of the web or desktop app.

1. Select **<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-credit-card"></i> Billing**.



1. Modify **Number of licenses for current billing period** or **Number of
   licenses for next billing period**, and click **Update**.

!!! tip ""

    You can only increase the number of licenses for the current billing period.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Temporary users and guests

### How will I be charged for temporary users (e.g. limited-time clients)?

Users [can be deactivated](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user) any time.
Deactivating a user frees up their license for reuse.

### How are guest accounts billed? Is there special pricing?

For an organization with N other users, 5*N [guest users](/help/guest-users)
are included at no extra charge. After that, you will be charged at 1/5 of
your regular per-user pricing for each additional guest.
