# Global times


When collaborating with people in different time zones, you often need to
express a specific time clearly. In Zulip, rather than typing out your time
zone and having everyone translate the time in their heads, you can insert
a time, and it will be displayed to each user in their own time zone (just
like timestamps on Zulip messages).




## Insert a time

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="via-compose-box-buttons">

1. [Open the compose box](/help/open-the-compose-box).




1. Click the **Add global time** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-time"></i>)
   icon at the bottom of the compose box to open the date picker.

1. Select the desired time by clicking with your mouse, or using the arrow
   keys + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. Click **Confirm** to insert the selected time.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="via-markdown">

1. [Open the compose box](/help/open-the-compose-box).




1. Type `<time`, and click **Mention a time-zone-aware time**, or press
   <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the date picker.

1. Select the desired time by clicking with your mouse, or using the arrow
   keys + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. Click **Confirm** to insert the selected time.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Examples

    You can also use other formats such as UNIX timestamps or human readable
    dates, for example, `<time:May 28 2020, 1:30 PM IST>`.

### What it looks like

> Our next meeting is scheduled for *Thu, May 28 2020, 1:00 AM*.

While someone in India will see:

> Our next meeting is scheduled for *Thu, May 28 2020, 1:30 PM*.
