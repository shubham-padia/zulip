# Organization language for automated messages and invitation emails


!!! warn ""

    This feature is only available to organization owners and administrators.





Zulip has been translated or partially translated into dozens of
languages by Zulip's amazing community of volunteer translators.
You can see which languages Zulip supports [on Transifex][transifex-zulip].

If you'd like to help by contributing as a translator, see the
[Zulip translation guidelines][translating-zulip] to get started.

Each user can use Zulip with [their preferred language][user-lang].
Additionally, if your organization has a primary language other than
American English, you can set the language used for the organization's
automated messages and invitation emails. This setting:

* Determines the language used for [automated
  notices](/help/configure-automated-notices) that are sent to channels, including
  both the topic name and message content. (Automated messages sent to a single
  user will use that user's preferred language).

* Determines the language used for outgoing
  [invitation emails](/help/invite-new-users).

* Is used as the default language for new user accounts when Zulip
  cannot detect their language preferences from their browser,
  including all users [created via the Zulip API][api-create-user].
