# User groups


User groups allow you to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) multiple users
at once. When you mention a user group, everyone in the group is
[notified](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) as if they were personally
mentioned. For example, you may choose to create user groups for teams in your
organization.




You can also:

- Add a user group to another user group. This individually adds all the users
  in the group.
- Subscribe a user group to a channel. This individually subscribes all the users
  in the group.
- Compose a [direct message](/help/direct-messages) to a user group. This
  automatically puts all the users in the group into the addressee field.
