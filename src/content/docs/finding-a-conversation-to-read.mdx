# Finding a conversation to read


In Zulip, a **conversation** is a [direct message](/help/direct-messages) thread
(one-on-one or with a group), or a [topic in a
channel](/help/introduction-to-topics).





It generally works best to read your messages organized by conversation.




## From the Inbox view


**Inbox** provides an overview of your conversations with unread messages.
Conversations are shown in the same order as in the left sidebar in the web app,
and you can collapse any channels you are not currently interested in.





<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-inbox"></i> **Inbox**
   (or <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-inbox"></i> if the **views**
   section is collapsed) in the left sidebar,
   or use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> keyboard shortcut.




1. Click on a conversation you're interested in to view it. You can return to
   **Inbox** when done to select the next conversation.

!!! tip ""

    You can collapse or expand the list of topics in a channel by clicking the
    **collapse**
    (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-arrow-down"></i>)
    or **expand**
    (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-arrow-down icon-collapsed-state"></i>)
    icon to the left of a channel name.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="mobile">

1. Tap the **Inbox**
   (<img src="/static/images/help/mobile-inbox-icon.svg" alt="inbox" class="help-center-icon"/>)
   tab in the bottom left corner of the app.

2. Tap on a conversation you're interested in to view it. You can return to
   **Inbox** when done to select the next conversation.

!!! tip ""

    You can collapse or expand the list of topics in a channel by tapping the
    **collapse**
    (<img src="/static/images/help/mobile-expand-less-icon.svg" alt="inbox" class="help-center-icon"/>)
    or **expand**
    (<img src="/static/images/help/mobile-expand-more-icon.svg" alt="inbox" class="help-center-icon"/>)
    icon to the left of a channel name.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>




## From Recent conversations


Use the **Recent conversations** view to get
an overview of all the ongoing conversations. This view is particularly useful
for catching up on messages sent while you were away.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-recent"></i> **Recent conversations**
   (or <i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-recent"></i> if the **views**
   section is collapsed) in the left sidebar,
   or use the <kbd>T</kbd> keyboard shortcut.




1. The filters at the top help you quickly find relevant conversations.
   For example, select **Participated** to filter to the conversations you
   have sent messages to.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

!!! tip ""

    The **Participants** column shows which users recently sent a message (newest on the left).




## From the left sidebar


In the web app, the left sidebar provides quick access to your direct messages,
and the channels you are subscribed to.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="desktop-web">

1. Click on **DIRECT MESSAGES** or the name of a channel in the left sidebar. You
   will see a list of the most recent unread conversations that you have not [muted](/help/mute-a-topic).

1. Click on the conversation you are interested in.

!!! tip ""

    To see all conversations, click on **more conversations** (in direct messages) or **more topics**
    (in a channel).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
