# Channel posting policy


!!! warn ""

    This feature is only available to organization owners and administrators.




By default, anyone who belongs to a channel can also send messages to
the channel. However, sometimes it's useful to have a channel (often a
[default channel](/help/set-default-channels-for-new-users)) where only
certain users can send messages.
