# Link to a message or conversation

Zulip makes it easy to share links to messages, topics, and channels. You can
link from one Zulip [conversation](/help/reading-conversations) to another, or
share links to Zulip conversations in issue trackers, emails, or other external
tools.

## Link to a channel or topic within Zulip

Zulip automatically creates links to channels and topics in messages you send.

The easiest way to link to a channel or topic is:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="instructions-for-all-platforms">

1. Type `#` followed by the one or more letters of the channel name.

1. Choose the desired channel from the auto-complete menu. The link will be
   automatically formatted for you.

1. If linking to a topic, type `>` after selecting a channel as
   described above, followed by one or more letters of the topic name.

1. Choose the desired topic from the auto-complete menu. The link will be
   automatically formatted for you.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, it is possible to manually format channel and topic links:

## Link to Zulip from anywhere

All URLs in Zulip are designed to be shareable.  Copying the URL from
the browser's address bar will work for all views, including searches.

### Get a link to a specific message

This copies to your clipboard a permanent link to the message,
displayed in its thread (i.e. topic view for messages in a channel).
Viewing a topic via a message link will never mark messages as read.

These links will still work even when the message is
[moved to another topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic)
or [channel](/help/move-content-to-another-channel) or
if its [topic is resolved](/help/resolve-a-topic).

Zulip uses the same permanent link syntax when [quoting a
message](/help/quote-and-reply).
