# Linking to the Zulip website


Zulip sponsors free [Zulip Cloud Standard](https://zulip.com/plans/) hosting for
hundreds of worthy organizations. Zulip has also invested into making it as easy
as possible to [self-host](https://zulip.com/self-hosting/) its [100%
open-source](https://github.com/zulip/zulip#readme) software. Read about the
[Zulip project values](https://zulip.com/values/) to learn more.




If your organization is sponsored by Zulip, or wishes to express appreciation
for the Zulip project, please help others find out about Zulip. To do so, follow the
guidelines below to list Zulip in the appropriate section of your organization's
website (e.g., **Sponsors** or **Acknowledgements**).
