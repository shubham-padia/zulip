In addition to the [mobile and desktop apps](https://zulip.com/apps/),
Zulip works great in all major modern web browsers. We recommend
pinning the Zulip tab in your favorite browser, so that it's always
easy to find.

For the best user experience, the latest stable versions of the
browsers below are recommended.

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/)
* [Edge](https://microsoft.com/en-us/edge/)
* [Safari](https://apple.com/safari/)

## Support policy

Zulip's browser support policy follows the
[`baseline widely available`](https://web.dev/baseline) target from
Browserslist. We display an in-product warning only when a browser in
Browserslist's
[all browsers query (`>= 0%`)](https://browsersl.ist/#q=%3E%3D+0%25)
target is older than the
[`baseline widely available`](https://web.dev/baseline) versions.
Experimental or niche browsers that aren't part of Browserslist's
[all browsers query (`>= 0%`)](https://browsersl.ist/#q=%3E%3D+0%25)
keep working without the warning.

## Multi protocol chat apps

Zulip is supported by most browser-based multi protocol desktop chat apps like
[Rambox](https://rambox.pro) and [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org/).

  an out-of-date app is a major security risk for your computer.
