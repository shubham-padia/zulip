<!--
We have an open PR to the upstream starlight repository to add support
for custom icons in the Aside starlight component. The PR is stalled
due to dependency on some of the custom icons work being done on 
starlight. We should replace the code below with the Aside starlight
component along with a custom icon (keyboard in out case).
